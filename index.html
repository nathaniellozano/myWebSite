        This is my 
        <a href="/documents/Nathaniel_Lozano.pdf">resume,</a>
        there are many like it but this one is mine
    </p>
    Nothing of much significance here yet, other than my resume. I am just getting to know the languages of html and css. I have some experience with Javascript so I will do what I can with that, at some point.
